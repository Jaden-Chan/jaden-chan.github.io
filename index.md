### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

  Lab 3, part 1 was a favorite because it was based on calculating BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate). Not only was I able to learn about how to calculate it, but I also learned how to calculate it through coding. I was able to work with variables that contained equations which helped calculate BMR for both men and women.

* Lab 5

  Lab 5, part 1 was really fun to do. Alongside my partner, we both worked together to create functions that could help us calculate the area of a rectangle for if we ever needed to do something along the lines of it in the future. Not only that, but it introduced us to the topic of modular programming since we were including separate files in our code to make it function properly.

* Lab 9

  Lab 9, part 1 was probably my favorite one to make because it was a literal dictionary. Depending on what was inputted into a text file, it would be read by the code and spellchecked to make sure that there are no errors. With the use of vectors, it would add the spelling error to the list to show which words are misspelled in the file so that it could be fixed.
